# create and clone repo can be done in two ways - 
'git clone <github repo url>' - this is used to clone an existing remote github repo to the local drive
'git init' - converts an existing local file into a repository ready for upload to github

# branches
create branch - 'git branch <new branch name>'
check the branch you are currently - 'git status'
merge a branch into the active/current one - 'git merge <branch name>'
push a local branch to the remote repo - 'git push, origin <branch name>'

# commits
create commit - 'git commit -m "<commit tag or comment>" '
reverse commit - 'git revert <commit tag>'

# push and pull
'git push' - is used to push staged files from local to remote repository
'git pull' - is used to pull changes from remote repository into the local repo to keep it updated

# fetch
'git fetch <repo name>' is used to pull in a different repository that is not yours
